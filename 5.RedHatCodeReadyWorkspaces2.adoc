= Deploy Golang App on Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces 2

== Prerequisites
* You have access to OpenShift Web Console URL. Ask your workshop coordinator for URL if you don't have one.
* You have credentials to login. Ask your workshop coordinator for credentials to log onto the OpenShift cluster
* You have access to a CodeReady Workspaces URL. Ask your workshop coordinator for URL if you don't have one.


== Introduction
CodeReady Workspaces 2.0 provides developer environments that are Kubernetes pods running on OpenShift. In those sandboxes are the components and tools needed to code on a project: a browser-based editor, the plugins, the tools, and the different runtimes required for your project. Everything is running in containers, providing highly consistent, repeatable, and reproducible developer environmentsâ€”zero config needed, zero pain.

Everything you need in your developer environment is fully containerized, even the editor and its plugins. CodeReady Workspaces isolates the tools from your application runtime, allowing you to bring your Kubernetes application into your developer sandbox, code on your application, and run it as in production. 

== Terms
A *workspace* is a development environment that can be likened to a PC loaded up with an operating system, programming language, tools, editor, and one or more development projects. You can even access a command line running in your browser.

A *stack* is a combination of operating system, programming language support, tools, and any other bits necessary to create a workspace. A workspace is built using a stack as the starting point. In this lab we wil be using the Go stack. 

A *factory* is the means by which you build and share your workspace(s).
