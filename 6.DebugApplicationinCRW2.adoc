= Deploy Golang App on Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces 2

== Prerequisites
* You have access to OpenShift Web Console URL. Ask your workshop coordinator for URL if you don't have one.
* You have credentials to login. Ask your workshop coordinator for credentials to log onto the OpenShift cluster
* You have access to a CodeReady Workspaces URL. Ask your workshop coordinator for URL if you don't have one.
* Completed <<5.RedHatCodeReadyWorkspaces2.adoc#, Using CodeReady Workspaces build containerized application in a container>>


== Introduction
CodeReady Workspaces 2.0 provides developer environments that are Kubernetes pods running on OpenShift. In those sandboxes are the components and tools needed to code on a project: a browser-based editor, the plugins, the tools, and the different runtimes required for your project. Everything is running in containers, providing highly consistent, repeatable, and reproducible developer environmentsâ€”zero config needed, zero pain.

== Exercise

=== CodeReady Workspaces 2 Debugging 
* Using the application deployed in Excerise <<5.whatever$, >>  we will debug and then deploy the application to OpenShift

=== Application Debugging
Click on the debug icon on the right hand of the screen.

Click on `No Configuration` then select `Add Configuration`.

Paste the following in the launch.json file
```
{
  // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
  // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
      {
          "name": "Launch file",
          "type": "go",
          "request": "launch",
          "mode": "debug",
          "program": "/projects/src/github.com/golang/example/main.go"
      }
  ]
}
```

Navigate back to `Explorer` and select the `main.go` file

* In Main.go navigate to line 19
* Click next to 19 to add line to debug

Click on the stop icon to stop debugging

=== OpenShift Deployment

Navigate to the terminal in CodeReady Workspaces 2

Login to OpenShift

Create new project
```
$ oc new-project codeready-app-userXX
```
NOTE: Change userXX to your username provided by your  workshop coordinator.

Create new build for Application
```
$ oc new-build --name goapp-userXX --binary --strategy docker
```

Upload local code and build it in openshift
```
$ oc start-build goapp-userXX  --from-dir=.
```

View the logs from the build
```
$ oc logs -f build/goapp-userXX -1
```

Create New app from binary build
```
$ oc new-app goapp-userXX  --name codeready-app-userXX
```

Get pod status.
```
$ oc get pods
```

Expose route to access the application externally. 
```
$ oc expose svc/goapp-userXX 
```

Get route
```
$ oc get route
```

Open url in webpage

Add the following to the end of the url `/?name=yourname` and press  `Enter`

Delete project
```
$ oc delete project userxx
```
