= Create an App from a Docker image

== Prerequisites
* You need API URL to the cluster. Ask your workshop coordinator, if you don't have one
* You need credentials (UserName and Password) to login to the cluster
* Login to the cluster running
```
$ oc login {CLUSTER_APIURL}
The server uses a certificate signed by an unknown authority.                                                                                                      
You can bypass the certificate check, but any data you send to the server could be intercepted by others.

Login successful.                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                   
You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                   
    oc new-project <projectname>                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                   
Welcome! See 'oc help' to get started.

== Introduction
In this lab you will learn to use openshift CLI to deploy an application.

== Deploy using OC

*Step 1: Add a new project from command line*

*Note:* Please replace *UserName* with the username assigned to you in the commands below. Project names in OpenShift must be unique across the cluster. In order not to have an overlap between all the users, we are using **UserName** to enforce uniqueness in the name.

....
$ oc new-project mycliproject-UserName --description="My CLI Project" --display-name="CLI Project"
....

**Note:** If you get an error message `The ProjectRequest "mycliproject-UserName" is invalid`, it means you have not substituted your UserName!!

Upon project creation, OpenShift will automatically switch to the newly created project/namespace. If you wish to view the list of projects, run the following command:

....
$ oc get projects
....

If you have more than one project, you can switch to a different one by issuing `oc project <project name>`. Although you donâ€™t want to do it now.

You can also check the status of the project by running the following command. It says that the project is currently not running anything.

....
$ oc status

In project CLI Project (mycliproject-UserName)

You have no services, deployment configs, or build configs.
Run 'oc new-app' to create an application.
....

*Step 2: Create an application from a Docker Image*

Next we will create an application inside the above project using an existing docker image. We will be using a very simple docker image on dockerhub.

First create a new application using the docker image using the
`oc new-app` command as shown below:

....
$ oc new-app redhatworkshops/welcome-php --name=welcome                                                                                       
--> Found container image 3e73433 (3 years old) from Docker Hub for "redhatworkshops/welcome-php"

    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:                                       
     'oc expose svc/welcome'                                                                                                                                       
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
....

The above command uses the docker image to deploy a docker container in
a pod. If you quickly run `oc get pods` you will notice that a deployer
pod runs and it starts an application pod as shown below.

....
$ oc get pods

NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
welcome-1-deploy   1/1       Running   0          1m
welcome-1-dkyyq    0/1       Pending   0          0s
....

In the above example `welcome-1-deploy` is the deployer pod and the other one is the actual application pod. In a little while the deployer
pod will succeed and the application pod will change for `Pending` to `Running` status.

....
$ oc get pods                                                                                                                                 
NAME               READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE                                                                                                              
welcome-1-c2pvs    1/1     Running     0          34s                                                                                                              
welcome-1-deploy   0/1     Completed   0          46s 
....

*Step 3: Add a Route for your application*

OpenShift also spins up a service for this application. Run the following command to view the list of services in the project (you can also use `oc get svc` shorthand).

....
$ oc get services

NAME      CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
welcome   172.30.77.93   <none>        8080/TCP   2m
....

You will notice the `welcome` service was created for this project.

However, there is no route for this application yet. So you cannot access this application from outside.

Now add a route to the service with the following command. `oc expose` command will allow you to expose your service to the world so that you can access it from the browser.

....
$ oc expose service welcome --name=welcome                                                                                                    
route.route.openshift.io/welcome exposed
....

Check the route created for your application now

```
$ oc get route                                                                                                                                
NAME      HOST/PORT                                               PATH   SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD                                              
welcome   welcome-mycliproject-UserName.apps.first.40.ocpcloud.com          welcome    8080-tcp                 None  
```

Note the URL listed under `HOST/PORT`.

*Step 4: Try your application*

Access the application: Now access the application using curl (looking
for 200 status code) or from the browser and see the result

....

$ curl -Is <route>
....

Voila!! you created an application on OpenShift using an existing docker image on OpenShift.

*Step 4: Clean up*

Run the `oc get all` command to view all the components that were
created in your project.

....
$ oc get all

Now you can delete all these components by running one command.

....
$ oc delete all --all

route.route.openshift.io "welcome" deleted 
....

You will notice that it has deleted the imagestream for the application, the deploymentconfig, the service and the route.

You can run `oc get all` again to make sure the project is empty.

Congratulations!! You now know how to create a project, an application using an external docker image and navigate around. Get ready for more
fun stuff!
