= Using ConfigMaps

== Prerequisites
* You have access to OpenShift Web Console URL. Ask your workshop coordinator for URL if you don't have one.
* You have credentials to login. Ask your workshop coordinator for credentials to log onto the OpenShift cluster
* Git must be installed on workstation. 

== Introduction
A `ConfigMap` object provides mechanisms to inject containers with configuration data while keeping containers agnostic of OpenShift Container Platform. A ConfigMap can be used to store fine-grained information like individual properties or coarse-grained information like entire configuration files or JSON blobs. In the lab below we will modify the properties file of a webpage using a `ConfigMap`.

The `ConfigMap` object holds key-value pairs of configuration data that can be consumed in pods or used to store configuration data. ConfigMaps is similar to secrets but it is not recommended for sensitive data. 

== Exercise
Clone configmap-demo from git
```
$ git clone https://github.com/tosin2013/configmap-demo.git
$ cd configmap-demo
```

Lets create a project 
```
$ oc new-project configmap-lab
```

Lets set the color we would like to use
```
$ export COLOR=red
$ echo "color=$COLOR" > ui.properties
```

Letâ€™s create a ConfigMap, named config, with both a literal text, message=YOUR MESSAGE, and the configuration file:
```
$ export PERSONAL_MESSAGE="YOUR MESSAGE"  # Change the message 
$ oc create configmap config \
            --from-literal=message="${PERSONAL_MESSAGE}" \
            --from-file=ui.properties
```

Check the contents of configmap/config
```
$ oc get configmap/config -o json
```

Create the app deploymet and build the app
```
$ oc create -f configmap-demo-build.yml
$ oc create -f  configmap-demo-deployment.yml
```

Check the deployment 
```
$  oc get pods
NAME                      READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
configmap-demo-1-build    0/1     Completed   0          4m29s
configmap-demo-1-deploy   0/1     Completed   0          3m18s
configmap-demo-1-kshbh    1/1     Running     0          3m9s
```

Launch Webpage 
```
$ oc get routes 
```

Update configmap 
```
$ export COLOR=green
$ echo "color=$COLOR" > ui.properties
```

Delete old config map 
```
$ oc delete  configmap config
```

Lets create a new config map
```
$ export PERSONAL_MESSAGE="NEW MESSAGE"  # Change the message 
$ oc create configmap config \
            --from-literal=message="${PERSONAL_MESSAGE}" \
            --from-file=ui.properties
```

Delete old config map pod
```
$ oc delete pod configmap-demo-1-kshbh
```

Check pod status 
```
$ oc get pods 
```

Reload Webpage 

Delete deployment 
```
$ oc delete -f configmap-demo-build.yml
$ oc delete -f  configmap-demo-deployment.yml
```

Delete project 
```
$ oc delete configmap-lab
```

== Summary
In this lab we learned how about configmaps and its uses. We also deployed a simple web  application and modified the properties and environment using configmaps.
